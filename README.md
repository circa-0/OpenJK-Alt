# OpenJK and then some

BaseJKA+ is a project based on OpenJK, that aims to add a couple more features for servers while sticking to what makes basejka great: simplicity but still feels vanilla. If you're unfamiliar with OpenJK, [click here](https://github.com/JACoders/OpenJK/blob/master/README.md) to read more about it. The JKHub release page can be found [here](https://jkhub.org/files/file/3243-basejka-server/).

Big shoutout to Smoo, Xycaleth and Raz0r for helping me with basically all of this. I had the features but they showed me how to get it done.
