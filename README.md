# OpenJK and then some

BaseJKA+ is a project based on OpenJK, that aims to add a couple more features for servers while sticking to what makes basejka great: simplicity but still feels vanilla. If you're unfamiliar with OpenJK, [click here](https://github.com/JACoders/OpenJK/blob/master/README.md) to read more about it.

# Changes and additions
1.00
* All taunts are available in all game modes (meditate, gloat, flourish, etc)
* Private duels now start with full health and shield, and can be changed via new cvars (g_duelStartHealth and g_duelStartArmor)
* Results of a private duel are displayed to all, with the remaining health of the winning player

1.02
* restored the ability to use map glitches via dmflags 520

1.03
